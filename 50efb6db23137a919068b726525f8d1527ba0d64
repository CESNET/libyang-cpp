      "message": "This looks like something which does not fit into the patch -- at least reading the commit message. I think that you probably realized that you do not need `m_valid` anymore now that you aren\u0027t updating that, but perhaps it\u0027s better to get rid of that boolean completely.\n\nCan you instead of `m_valid` use `!!m_refs`? It looks like something that can be set to nullptr to indicate this invalid state. That should be done in an extra commit.",
