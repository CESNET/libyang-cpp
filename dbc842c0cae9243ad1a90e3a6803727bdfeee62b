      "message": "It seems to me that the STL, iterator_traits and other related bits of code prefer to have a \"sentinel\" which is often used to refer to an past-the-end iterator. These are called \"singular values\", and they are by definition not associated to any sequence. This patch instead associates the `end` value with a collection (\"sequence\" in STL terms I guess).\n\nI guess prefer changing comparisons (etc) so that they explicitly allow working with `end`. I hope that there\u0027s some clean way of distinguishing \"end\" and an \"invalidated iterator\".\n\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator#Definitions",
