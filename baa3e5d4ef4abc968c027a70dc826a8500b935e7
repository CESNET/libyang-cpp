Is this a DFS iteration or a BFS iteration or a direct-children-only iteration?\n\nI assume that you\u0027ll need more \"types of iteration\" later, which is presumably why there\u0027s no direct begin()/end() right in the SchemaNode, but that\u0027s one more reason to include the \"kind of iteration\" in the class name.",
