      "message": "I re-read the patches a few times and Vasek explained this to me. There was a build failure due to an incompatible change upstream, and a test failure due to a behavior change. Because we do not CI-gate the upstream project, both changes had to be implemented here in this patch. The next one then implements a proper fix with validation.\n\nThere\u0027s no need to reword the commits (IMHO) because the cloud infra is once again having a great day with IPv4 address availability, yay.",
