      "message": "Upstream libyang released a \"v3\" under the \"v2.2\" name, which was rather confusing. Which specific version of libyang do you use?\n\nWhat do you mean by \"removing the C version library from linked dependencies\"?\n\nAnyway -- our internal porting effort is actually blocked by some changes in libnetconf2 and the user-visible change to YANG modules of Netopeer2 which *predated* the libyang v3 ABI change. As a result, we \"could\" switch to libyang v3 very, very easily (the patches are mostly trivial if one has a reasonable test coverage), but the Netopper2 changes are taking us some time to properly implement, and it\u0027s not possible to use \"Netopeer from end of 2023\" with libyang v3.",

      "message": "1) We currently use the C++ wrappings for libyang, sysrepo and libnetconf.\nSince the last one is locked at a specific version - pre-yang-v2.2/3; you replied to my issue on GitHub libnetconf2-cpp#3 - we are \"at the same level\" with all versions. Once the bindings are updated we\u0027ll switch to the latest version.\n\n2) I mean that as a hack for the time being, instead of calling the unlink method on a fixed version of the C++ wrapping, we used libyang\u0027s C functions.\nWe use CMake so we added an import target for libyang (C) - already present on the system because of the wrappers - but this shouldn\u0027t be necessary if the fix were in libyang-cpp.",
