      "message": "OK, on a second though, I think this is actually not a best way to go. At least in the beginning, this library will be moving much quicker than libyang2; chances are that you\u0027ll add, say, support for operator[] or fancy iteration in between of libyang releases. Therefore I think it\u0027s better to decouple the version of the bindings and the version of libyang now that they are managed as independent projects.\n\nPlease check if the git-produced versions (at least if you tag a 0.1 release first) are usable in pkg-config. If not, we might have to hardcode the version here (and check at build time that it matches the git tag if possible).",
