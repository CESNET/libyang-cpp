      "message": "I don\u0027t know how feasible this is going to be (i.e., how are you using this from netconf-cli?), but I can imagine that this might return \"large data\". Is that a common scenario? If yes, then supporting iteration looks like a good thing to me. Would it work for you if this *only* supported iteration? I\u0027m thinking that hopefully things like std::all_of or std::any_of etc will make it \"reasonably simple\" to work with -- and if you need, converting an iterator range to a vector should be easy enough, I guess.\n\nI also think that simply adding begin/end to this class (with an undefined order of iteration among the resulting set) is perfectly OK here. It\u0027s a set, and a set implies \"no order\" to me in the mathematical sense.\n\nTL;DR: is iteration feasible as the only API here?\n\nI think this smells of ranges/views already, but unfortunately I haven\u0027t used them yet...",
