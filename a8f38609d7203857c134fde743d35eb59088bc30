      "message": "I tried to add support for when (lysc_when_when) statement. \n\nUnfortunately, I was able to transform `cond` to string only. If I try to access `cond` object (which is of type `lyxp_expr`) to represent expression as an object, it ends with error:\n\n```\n/Users/bedrich.schindler/Projekty/libyang-cpp/src/SchemaNode.cpp: In member function \u0027std::string_view libyang::When::condition() const\u0027:\n/Users/bedrich.schindler/Projekty/libyang-cpp/src/SchemaNode.cpp:92:15: error: variable \u0027lyxp_expr cond\u0027 has initializer but incomplete type\n   92 |     lyxp_expr cond \u003d *m_when-\u003econd;\n```\n\nYou can end up with this error with following modification:\n\n```\nstd::string_view When::condition() const\n{\n    lyxp_expr cond \u003d *m_when-\u003econd;\n    return lyxp_get_expr(m_when-\u003econd);\n}\n```\n\nCould you help me with this? I think that `when` representation would be better in form of object instead of string.",

If you think that there\u0027s value in making this public, please ask for that upstream in libyang\u0027s github.\n\nI wonder what\u0027s your use case, though. Implementing this properly sounds like a big task, roughly half as big as reimplementing the client-side validation.",
