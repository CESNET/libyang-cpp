      "message": "I tried to add support for when (lysc_when_when) statement. \n\nUnfortunately, I was able to transform `cond` to string only. If I try to access `cond` object (which is of type `lyxp_expr`) to represent expression as an object, it ends with error:\n\n```\n/Users/bedrich.schindler/Projekty/libyang-cpp/src/SchemaNode.cpp: In member function \u0027std::string_view libyang::When::condition() const\u0027:\n/Users/bedrich.schindler/Projekty/libyang-cpp/src/SchemaNode.cpp:92:15: error: variable \u0027lyxp_expr cond\u0027 has initializer but incomplete type\n   92 |     lyxp_expr cond \u003d *m_when-\u003econd;\n```\n\nYou can end up with this error with following modification:\n\n```\nstd::string_view When::condition() const\n{\n    lyxp_expr cond \u003d *m_when-\u003econd;\n    return lyxp_get_expr(m_when-\u003econd);\n}\n```\n\nCould you help me with this? I think that `when` representation would be better in form of object instead of string.",
