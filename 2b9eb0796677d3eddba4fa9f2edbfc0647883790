      "message": "I think this has too big of a potential for clashes. pkg-config is going to add, say, $TARGET/include/libyang-cpp into my include path, and in that directory I\u0027m going to see a file named \"Context.hpp\". What I would prefer is pkg-config still adding this namespace-qualified prefix, but then #include-ing the file as \u003clibyang-cpp/Context.hpp\u003e.\n\nThis might need reshuffling the source tree so that instead of, say, src/Context.hpp you have include/Context.hpp; that way you can install via a GLOB.",
