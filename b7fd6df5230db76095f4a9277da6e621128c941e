      "message": "That\u0027s a pretty big change. I thought that these wrappers make some assumptions (such as where a particular `lyd_node*` \"comes from\", about when it\u0027s safe to free them, etc). These assumptions might not hold anymore once you let the user create these, and that might have serious implications to object lifetimes. Are you 100% positive you want to allow this? Just removing a bunch of `friend` statements is not enough of a reason.",
