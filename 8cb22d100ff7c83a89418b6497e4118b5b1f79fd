      "message": "Can you please split the test refactoring into a separate patch? It\u0027s easier to reason about \"move only\" changes. Also, on a quick glance it appears that you\u0027re renaming stuff, which is OK, but please describe that in the commit message so that I have an easier job :).\n\n(Technically speaking, a cherry-pick your test changes without the min/max list items into a commit on top of current master, turn that into a commit with a fresh change-id footer, and then rebase this commit on top of the new one while keeping this commit\u0027s Change-Id footer. That will make Gerrit (and me) happy because all review comments will be preserved. Thanks!)",
