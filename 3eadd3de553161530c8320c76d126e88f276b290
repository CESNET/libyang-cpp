      "message": "...I realize that this comment is mainly about the behavior of the C library, but I really don\u0027t see how this is different from the RESTCONF parsing above. In case of a RESTCONF RPC, \"the parent is also set\", but we still get some data. This invocation is very similar, but now in case of a \"RPC YANG\", whatever it is because it\u0027s not covered by any RFC, the function returns nothing. That\u0027s strange, because in case of a RESTCONF RPC input, we get at least that dummy value (with no children) back.\n\nCan you clarify this with Michal, please?",
