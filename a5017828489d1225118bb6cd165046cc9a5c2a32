      "message": "I suggest making this one inline:\n\n- I think we do not *want* any encapsulation here; the need for a proxy class is imposed by the language because it really really wants to take an address of something.\n- If it\u0027s inline, it allows (at least in theory) more opportunities for the optimizer to \"see through\" that extra layer of indirection.\n- I think it\u0027s just easier to deal with inline template methods instead of instantiating them explicitly.",
