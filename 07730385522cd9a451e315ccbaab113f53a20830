      "message": "Yeah, I guess it is supposed to be opaque, but the c-api calls it opaq. It is actually a \"data-only node\". That means that it doesn\u0027t have any info about it in the schema. It\u0027s something like \"possibly unvalidated freestyle data\". Imagine a generic JSON/XML. In libnetconf2 it is used for info about RPC communication.\n\nIt seems like I don\u0027t need to support anymore. I\u0027ll leave this patch unmerged for now.",
